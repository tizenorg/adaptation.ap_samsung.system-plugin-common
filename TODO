log:

* There is no regular log api in this package. We need some of regular
  log api or wrapper.

ghost:

* boottime check point is hard coded now. That should be configurable.

* bootloader time is not ready yet. After that ghost have to generate
  time that and sum of that and platform boot time.

* ghost dir disk usage threshold should be configurable.

* bootchart generate directory should be parsed by bootchart.conf. Now
  it is hard coded to "/run/log".
